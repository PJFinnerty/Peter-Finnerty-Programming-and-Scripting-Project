Content: 
K-nearest neighbour classification model.
Four steps of model training/prediction in sklearn.
How to apply these steps to other ML models.

Steps:
1. Pick a value for K (look forward for explanation on how to do this)
2. Search for K obvs in training data (known Iris') to find 5 nearest measurements to unknown vector.
3. Use the most popular response value from the 5 nearest measurements as the value for the unknown Iris.

Looking at training data that is NOT the Iris dataset, we observe:
A dataset with 2 numerical features represented by the x and y corrordinates. Each point represents an 
obervation and the colour represents its response class: red, blue or green.

Looking at a 'KNN Classification map of K=1:
The background has been coloured based on the colour (or the response class) of the nearest neighbour.
Essentially, the background colour tells you what the predicted response value would be for a new observation
depending on its x and y features.

Looking at a 'KNN Classification map of K=5:
In this map, since K=5, a larger number of neighbouring point are considered in determining the predicted 
response value. Hence, previously when K=1, if the nearest neighbour was green, the predicted response was
green. With K=5, if 1 of the 5 nearest neighbours is green and 4 are blue, then the predicted response is 
blue.
